# Introduction

Arguably the biggest challenge faced by community ecologists is to understand,
and predict, how ecosystem properties will change in the face of
large-scale disturbance events. Ecosystems functions emerge from both the
identity of local species, and the way they interact, in a given
environmental context. Species range shift, micro-evolutionary
changes, and rapid environmental variation, is therefore expected to
disrupt the current state of communities, and thus change the way
ecosystems function. Although hypotheses have been generated, and data
gathered, regarding the relationship between community structure and
ecosystem properties, it is not clear whether they are sufficient to
*predict*  the outcome of large-scale changes. The core issue lies in
the fact that emerging communities, rather than being an additive
combination of existing ones (*e.g.* species from site A relocate to
site B to track their temperature optimum), will be entirely
novel ones. This novelty will emerge through a variety of ecological
and micro-evolutionary mechanisms. **(i)** Species will use different
tactics to cope with change, that can result in any combination of
range shift, and rapid adaptation. **(ii)** Because of the precedent
point, this will result in either new species entering existing
interaction networks, or establishing different interactions within
them. Finally, **(iii)**, the environmental conditions themselves will
change, affecting the traits, abundances, and presence of different
species. Because all of these mechanisms are interwoven in feedbacks,
the way we approach them should incorporate concepts and elements
from separate bodies of work, and focus on understanding which are
well-articulated, and which are not.

1. Literature on species interactions at the community level neglected variation in either species, or the way they interact
2. Accounting for species interaction is needed to predict biogeo distribution and response to global changes
3. Accounting for micro-evolutionary changes is important to predict response to global changes as well
4. The establishment of interactions relies on traits (mis)matching, so the consequences of biogeo/evo changes must be done in a trait-explicit framework
