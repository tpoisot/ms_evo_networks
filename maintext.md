# Introduction

1. Literature on species interactions at the community level neglected variation in either species, or the way they interact
2. Accounting for species interaction is needed to predict biogeo distribution and response to global changes
3. Accounting for micro-evolutionary changes is important to predict response to global changes as well
4. The establishment of interactions relies on traits (mis)matching, so the consequences of biogeo/evo changes must be done in a trait-explicit framework

# The state of the art

## Network theory:

## Biogeography:

## Coevolution: 

# The current overlap

## The good: biogeographic perspectives on coevolution

## The bad: understanding network variation over space

## The ugly: evolution of networks, evolution in networks

# The road to synthesis

## Scaling-up coevolutionary concepts

## Scaling-down the species interaction network paradigm

# Perspectives
